# 4-bit Multiplier

This repository contains the Verilog code for a **4-bit multiplier**, which multiplies two 4-bit binary numbers and produces an 8-bit product. The multiplier is implemented using half-adders, full-adders, and logic gates.

## Project Overview

The project implements a 4-bit binary multiplier that computes the product of two 4-bit inputs, `a` and `b`. The result of the multiplication is an 8-bit output `pro`. This multiplier is designed using a combination of:
- **Half Adders (HA)**
- **Full Adders (FA)**
- Basic logic gates (AND, XOR, etc.)

### Features

- **4-bit binary inputs**: Two 4-bit input numbers, `a` and `b`.
- **8-bit output**: An 8-bit result representing the product of `a` and `b`.
- **Adder-based design**: Uses half adders and full adders to sum partial products.
- **Testbench**: Includes a testbench to simulate the functionality of the multiplier.
